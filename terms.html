        <ul>
            <li>You consent to a brief liveness check during setup. We do not retain facial images or long‑term biometric templates.</li>
            <li>You select your preferred community experience; selection is user‑controlled and not based on gender inference.</li>
            <li>To promote stability and reduce abuse, community changes are limited to once every 90 days.</li>
